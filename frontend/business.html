      <p>Our business model centers on a Carpooling App designed to reward users with carbon credits for choosing eco-friendly commuting options. This incentivizes sustainable transportation practices by offering users flexibility in redeeming or trading their earned carbon credits. Through integration with carbon credit marketplaces and transaction fees on credit trades, we generate revenue. Additionally, we offer businesses an opportunity to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing carbon credits, creating a win-win situation for users, the company, and the environment, all while promoting cleaner commuting habits.</p>
